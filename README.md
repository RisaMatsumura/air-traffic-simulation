# air-traffic-simulation

About the program:
Air Traffic Simulation is a simple program that simulates air traffic and produces stats based on the simulation. The program contains 3 types of planes: commercial planes, light planes, and glider, and each has a different frequency. User is asked to set a frequency of commercial planes (frequencies of other planes are already set), the duration of a simulation in hour, a number of times simulation will run to average the stats, and the based on the inputs the program will out the satats.

Motivation:
This project was originally a group project during my 1st year at university within a team of 4 students. There were a limited time to build the system and I wanted to try building it for myself so decided to rewrite it from scratch.

To-do:
At the moment the program has a level 2 priority which gives priorities to arrival planes over departure planes.
At the moment the implementation is at draft stage, and I hope to improve the GUI and implement some validations for users input. I also hope to implement level 1 priority in near future where arrival planes with least remaining fuel are given priorities over the rest of the planes waiting to land/take off.
